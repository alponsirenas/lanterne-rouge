Title	Type	Notes
Build Reflection Agent v1	Issue	Track and analyze past observations, decisions, and outcomes to detect patterns and inform future reasoning.
Enable Adaptive Micro-Cycle Adjustment	Issue	Allow the agent to modify periodization (block structures) dynamically based on real fatigue and recovery trends.
Support Dynamic MissionConfig Updates	Issue	Allow controlled, micro-adjustments to mission targets (e.g., CTL tuning) based on observed performance.
Expand Multi-Stage Event Support	Issue	Prepare the system for complex event simulations (Tour, Everest, Multi-sport, etc.) with stage-specific demands.
Add Reflection Summaries to GUI	Issue	Display key agent reflections: what it learned this week, what changes it made, what patterns it detected.
