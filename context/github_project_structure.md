👉 Would you also like me to draft one more template for v0.5.0 — Reflection and Adaptation
so you’re fully ready for long-term growth planning? 🚀
(Optional but very smart to have it ready.)
Ready? 🎯

✅ Perfect —
let’s complete the full set and prepare the v0.5.0 GitHub Project Template
focused on Reflection and Adaptation.

Title	Type	Notes
Build Reflection Agent v1	Issue	Track and analyze past observations, decisions, and outcomes to detect patterns and inform future reasoning.
Enable Adaptive Micro-Cycle Adjustment	Issue	Allow the agent to modify periodization (block structures) dynamically based on real fatigue and recovery trends.
Support Dynamic MissionConfig Updates	Issue	Allow controlled, micro-adjustments to mission targets (e.g., CTL tuning) based on observed performance.
Expand Multi-Stage Event Support	Issue	Prepare the system for complex event simulations (Tour, Everest, Multi-sport, etc.) with stage-specific demands.
Add Reflection Summaries to GUI	Issue	Display key agent reflections: what it learned this week, what changes it made, what patterns it detected.

✅
This project focuses on making Lanterne Rouge not just agentic,
but self-improving and adaptive.
