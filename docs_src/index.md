# Lanterne Rouge

Lanterne Rouge started with the idea of completing an AI generated indoor simulation of the Tour de France 2025.

Designed to observe your recovery, reason about your daily readiness, and adapt dynamically to your life and training, Lanterne Rouge plans your next steps without losing sight of your long-term goals.

## How It Works

Lanterne Rouge integrates data from your Oura Ring and Strava to understand your fitness, fatigue, and recovery. Each day, it analyzes this information to generate a personalized coaching report and update your training schedule. This ensures your plan adapts to your progress and needs.

By integrating with your existing tools, Lanterne Rouge helps you stay consistent without adding complexity. Whether you follow structured workouts, use cycling platforms, or ride by feel, the application adapts to keep you moving forward.
