	### 🚴 Stage 1 Ride Options

	#### 🏆 Breakaway Mode
	
	"Go from the gun, fight to make the break, drive hard until caught near the finish, maybe dream of a miracle."

	- Warm-up and initial surges as the break forms on flat roads
	- Extended high-tempo pulls as the breakaway works together to build a gap
	- Occasional Z4 surges to simulate TV time and KOM/sprint points, plus brief spells of recovery
	- The intensity ramps again for the imagined "final push" before the sprinters' teams reel you in
	- Survive, then spin it out with the peloton at the end
	
	#### 🦺 GC Mode

	"Stay protected in the peloton, minimize risk, let the sprinters and breakaway specialists play."

	- Long, controlled tempo at Z2–low Z3, shielded by teammates
	- Only one or two brief moments of harder effort—responding to a split or late crash
	- Emphasis is on smooth pedaling, saving energy, and staying out of trouble
	- Cool down with the group after the finish
