	### 🚴 Stage 2 Ride Options

	#### 🏆 Breakaway Mode
	
	"Attack the early climbs, fight for KOM points, and try to hold the gap over the rolling terrain. Survive the final climbs and hope to win from the break."

	- Early surges and high-tempo riding as the break forms on the first hills
	- Several blocks at or above threshold, corresponding to the main climbs and KOMs
	- Rolling tempo in between as the breakaway tries to cooperate and keep the gap
	- Short, sharp final push to simulate the late attacks on the last climbs
	- Ease up for the last few minutes as the peloton closes in
	
	#### 🦺 GC Mode

	"Ride in the wheels, let teammates work on the climbs, only respond if favorites move."

	- Steady tempo, controlled by the team
	- Slightly higher intensity on the key climbs (but nothing red-lined)
	- Save your legs for later—if someone attacks, just match their move, then settle back in
	- Spin it out in the group to finish
