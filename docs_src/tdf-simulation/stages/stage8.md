# Stage 8 — Saint-Méen-le-Grand > Laval

## Stage Profile and Strategy

- **Terrain**: Classic flat sprinter's stage—long, mostly flat roads, some gentle undulations, but minimal climbing.
- **Race Narrative**:
	- Early: Break goes, peloton controls, not much urgency.
	- Mid: The break gets a leash; some minor surges for intermediate sprints.
	- Finale: All about the run-in to a bunch sprint, with a few minutes of chaos at the end!
- **Sporting Stakes**: Sprint points, small breakaway glory, but high odds for a peloton finish.
