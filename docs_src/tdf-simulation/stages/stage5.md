# Stage 5 — Caen > Caen (ITT)

## Stage Profile and Strategy

- **Terrain**: Flat to gently rolling, short time trial (think ~30 km in the real Tour).
- **Race Narrative**:
	- No breakaways—just you against the clock.
	- For GC: Ride at steady high tempo, but don't go into the red unless you're a TT specialist.
	- For Breakaway: "Pretend you're the wildcard—take risks, try to post a heroic time, ignore tomorrow's fatigue."
- **Sporting Stakes**: GC time gaps possible, TT specialists chase glory.
