# Stage 4 — Rolling Hills/Breakaway Stage

## Stage Profile and Strategy

- **Terrain**: Rolling, classic breakaway stage with three short categorized climbs, no long mountains.
- **Race Narrative**:
	- Early flat = break forms, peloton not too interested.
	- Climbs come in the middle third—opportunity for points and break-splitting attacks.
	- Last third: rolling/false flat, break fights for survival, solo attempts possible.
	- If the break gets caught late, the pace drops—otherwise, it's all-out to the line.
- **Sporting Stakes**: KOM points mid-stage, possible sprint bonuses, small time gaps possible.
