# Stage 9 — Flat Crosswind Stage

## Stage Profile and Strategy

- **Terrain**: Flat, likely crosswinds in the Loire valley. A classic "nervous" stage—exposed roads mean the peloton could split into echelons.
- **Race Narrative**:
	- Early: Nervous start, everyone wants front position.
	- Mid: Crosswind zones may break up the race, hard efforts to get in the right group.
	- Finale: Sprinters' teams try to bring it back, but splits may stick.
- **Sporting Stakes**: Time gaps possible if splits happen, sprint points, breakaways often doomed.
