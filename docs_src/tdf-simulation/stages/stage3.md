# Stage 3 — Flat Crosswind Stage

## Stage Profile and Strategy

- **Terrain**: Flat with wide open agricultural roads, vulnerable to wind.
- **Race Narrative**:
	- Early: Break goes, but everyone's nervous about echelons if crosswinds start.
	- Mid: Fast, aggressive tempo—teams fight for position, splits can happen at any time.
	- Finale: Either the peloton regroups for a sprint, or a small group stays away if the wind has blown the race apart.
- **Sporting Stakes**: Sprint points, GC contenders can gain or lose big in crosswinds.

	### 🚴 Stage 3 Ride Options

	#### 🏆 Breakaway Mode
	
	"Jump in the early break, push hard whenever the crosswind sections appear, try to hold off the charging peloton until the last kilometers."

	- Start aggressive, fight to get away
	- Sustained high effort through the wind-prone midsection—imagine forming or responding to echelons
	- Short, sharp blocks for "holding the gap" under pressure
	- Finish with a last push or ease up when caught, then roll in
	
	#### 🦺 GC Mode

	"Stay near the front, out of trouble. When the echelons start, respond—but otherwise, keep it smooth and safe."

	- Early alertness, but mainly steady riding
	- One or two periods of higher intensity when the bunch splits
	- Quickly settle down once the danger passes, and ride in for the finish
