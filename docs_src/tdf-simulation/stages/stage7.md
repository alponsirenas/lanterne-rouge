# Stage 7 — Punchy Finale Stage

## Stage Profile and Strategy

- **Terrain**: Hilly, undulating stage with a steep uphill finish (Mûr-de-Bretagne) that favors explosive puncheurs and aggressive breakaways.
- **Race Narrative**:
	- Early: Break forms on rolling terrain.
	- Middle: Series of short climbs; peloton lets the break go, but GC teams ride defensively.
	- Finale: The steep Mûr-de-Bretagne (often twice in the final 20 km) – a brutal punchy finish with attacks from GC and breakaway survivors.
- **Sporting Stakes**: KOM/sprint points mid-stage, and possible small GC time gaps on the finale.
