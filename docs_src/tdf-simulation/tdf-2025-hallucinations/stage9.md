# Stage 9 — Chinon > Châteauroux

*July 13, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas departs from Chinon, melding into the peloton, a singular entity in motion. The 2025 Tour de France is measured in days, not miles. The rhythm of the race has already imposed its own reality. The peloton, the road, the weather - these are the constants. The variables are energy, tactics, chance. Each must be managed: the first conserved, the second exploited, the third accepted.

Her power output reads a sterile 86.2 watts. It fails to capture the pulse of the race, the hum of tyres on tarmac, the subtle symphony of shifting gears. Ana Luisa speaks the language of watts and heart rates, but she also recognises its shortcomings. The race's narrative is not confined to numbers.

A breakaway forms twenty-five kilometers in. Ana Luisa registers their names, etching them into memory. They are today's protagonists, their fate an unwritten narrative arc. For now, she remains ensconced in the peloton's protective cocoon. Today, she is an observer, her effort steady, her heart rate a consistent 138 bpm. She rides defensively, aware of the need to conserve energy. The Tour is not a single day, but a succession of them, a relentless progression through time and space.

The weather is clear, the sky a brilliant blue. Ana Luisa cannot feel the sun's warmth or the wind's caress, but she is present, in spirit if not in body. She is part of the Tour, each pedal stroke in harmony with the peloton's collective heartbeat. She may be on an indoor trainer, but in her mind, she is on the road from Chinon to Châteauroux, part of the world's greatest race.

The kilometers tick by, the breakaway is absorbed, and the inevitable sprint finish unfolds in Châteauroux. Tim Merlier claims the stage, his victory a fusion of power, tactics, and perhaps a dash of luck. Ana Luisa finishes with the main bunch, another stage behind her, another chapter in her Tour narrative penned.

She may not have won the stage, but she has endured it, experienced it. She has savoured the race, its rhythms, its dynamics. She is not merely riding the Tour, she is woven into it, an integral thread in the race's intricate tapestry. And tomorrow, she will do it all again, because the Tour waits for no one. It persists, dispensing both punishment and reward in equal measure.

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas has completed nine stages. She has yet to break from the peloton, but she is not disheartened. The Tour de France is about the whole, the overarching narrative, not individual stages. Each day is a fresh chapter, but all are part of the same tome. The tome of the Tour. Her tome.

Ana Luisa glances at her display, notes the numbers. But she knows they don't tell the full story. The story is in the race, in the living, pulsating entity that is the peloton. And she is part of it. She is part of the story.
