# Stage 4 — Amiens Métropole > Rouen

*July 08, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas embarks from Amiens Métropole, her cycle computer reading a crisp zero. Her heartbeat, a steady 134.4 bpm, is the metronome of an experienced rider. The skies are clear, the morning heralding a day of fair-weather racing. It's the fourth stage of the Tour de France 2025, and she is a part of the peloton, a GC contender by both choice and circumstance.

The peloton finds its rhythm, a symphony of tires humming on the simulated tarmac and the whir of her indoor trainer. Ana Luisa's power hovers around 85.9W, a sustainable effort. Her body finds the familiar equilibrium between exertion and conservation. There are 174.2 kilometers to traverse today. She's here for the long haul, not a fleeting burst of glory.

In their pixelated world, the breakaway forms. A cluster of animated figures representing a day-long breakaway pulls away after the 25km mark, tiny avatars disappearing into the virtual horizon. Ana Luisa holds back. She understands her strengths, the virtue of patience. She's here for the journey, for the immersion, for the cerebral game.

She observes as her peloton swallows the breakaway, the catch happening in that elusive moment between seconds and minutes where the clock is irrelevant and only the race matters. It's a strategic ballet, a display of power and control, and she's a part of it. She's a part of this world.

Ana Luisa reflects on the stages she's completed, three so far, and the ones that lie ahead. Each completed stage brings a unique satisfaction, a sense of achievement that outshines any medal or trophy. This is her fourth consecutive day in the saddle, another day added to the tally. She's not a sprinter, not a breakaway specialist, but a survivor. And in this race, survival is its own victory.

Tadej Pogacar claims the stage. The announcement echoes through her headphones, another triumph for the young Slovenian. Ana Luisa crosses the finish line in Rouen, encircled by her virtual teammates, finishing in the main bunch where she belongs. A spark of joy, of contentment, flares within her. She's lived another day in the peloton's world, savored the drama and excitement of the Tour de France.

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas slows to a halt, the screen in front of her marking the end of the stage. She's more than a spectator now, more than a fan. She's a participant, a player in this grand chess game on wheels. And as she wipes the sweat from her brow and reaches for her water bottle, she knows she wouldn't have it any other way.
