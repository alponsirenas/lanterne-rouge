# Stage 3 — Valenciennes > Dunkerque

*July 07, 2025*

⸻

The peloton stirs to life in Valenciennes. Within its pulsating mass, Ana Luisa Ponsirenas, an experienced amateur, finds her place, her thighs alight with anticipation. She is a protected rider today, her role to respond to the unfolding drama with measured calm. Her heart ticks away at a steady 146.2 bpm, a silent testament to her fitness and determination to conquer this stage of the Tour de France simulation.

Through her virtual lens, she observes Jonas Rickaert and Matej Mohoric break away at the 10km mark. A fleeting rebellion she chooses not to join. Her strategy is conservation, her power output a steady 94.8 watts. Today, for Ana Luisa, it's not about winning, it's about enduring.

The kilometers unfurl like a blank manuscript. At the 95km mark, calamity strikes. Jasper Philipsen, a sprinter's favourite, crashes during an intermediate sprint. His abrupt exit reshapes the race dynamics, a shift Ana Luisa navigates with cool efficiency. She understands that each crash, each withdrawal, reshapes the peloton's psychology, altering alliances, creating opportunities.

At 147km, Tim Wellens lunges forward, a man driven by a relentless thirst for King of Mountain points. Ana Luisa watches him, detached yet alert. She could match his energy, even surpass it, but today is not about individual glory. It's about immersion, understanding the peloton's intricate ballet, surviving the Tour's merciless, grinding beauty.

The skies above Dunkerque are clear, the roads kissed by sunlight. A gentle 19°C treats the riders kindly. A headwind teases them in the finale, a test of their resolve. In the final sprint, it is Tim Merlier who outmaneuvers Jonathan Milan, seizing an opportunity born from Philipsen's misfortune.

Ana Luisa crosses the finish line with the main bunch, not a victor, but a survivor. She's ridden defensively, completing her third stage of the Tour, her spirit intact, her mind sharp. Silent witnesses to her resolve are the statistics of her journey: a sixty-minute ride, zero significant intervals, an FTP of 128W.

Today, she was a protected rider in the peloton; tomorrow, who knows? Each day brings a new role, a new challenge, a new chapter. The Tour is a living narrative, and Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is ready to pen her next page.

For now, she pauses to reflect, to honour the effort, the strategy, and the honest assessment of her capabilities. Tomorrow, she will rise again, ready to navigate the mental and physical chess game that is the Tour de France.
