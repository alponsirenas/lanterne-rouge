# Stage 11 — Toulouse > Toulouse

*July 16, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas, a knot of anticipation in her gut, rolls away from the start line in Toulouse. She is a single cell within the peloton, a collective organism pulsating with a shared purpose - to endure the day.

The ride's rhythm is hypnotic, her effort steady, her power output a consistent 113.9W. Her heart, a metronome at 157.6 bpm, sets the tempo. No sprints, no attacks, just the relentless grind of threshold effort.

She observes the breakaway establish itself at the 25.0km mark - a daring act of defiance by riders known to her only by surname and jersey color. The peloton responds, not with anger, but with the cold, calculated patience of a predator. The day is long, the roads looping back to Toulouse. Ana Luisa feels the gravitational pull of the main bunch. She holds her position, conserves her energy.

The French countryside, bathed in sunlight, scrolls across her screen. The world beyond her window is distant, irrelevant to the stretch of road that holds her captive.

She is peripherally aware of the unfolding drama - the breakaway's futile flight, the peloton's relentless pursuit. Behind the spectacle, calculations are made, strategies adjusted. The name Abrahamsen is murmured, first with curiosity, then with growing respect. Ana Luisa notes it, files it away in the race's ledger.

The finish line, a flickering promise on the horizon, draws closer. Ana Luisa's legs are mere machinery, steady engines propelling her towards the end. There is no sprint, no triumphant surge of power. Only the relentless rhythm of her pedaling and the crossing of an invisible line.

Jonas Abrahamsen wins the stage, his victory boldly displayed across the screen. Ana Luisa finishes within the main bunch, her virtual self lost in the sea of riders. She is part of the peloton, a cell within the organism, surviving another day in cycling's most beautiful and brutal spectacle.

She has now completed 11 stages, the halfway point of the Tour. Each day, each kilometer, each pedal stroke is an affirmation of her place in this grand narrative. It's not about winning, she understands. It's about enduring, about being woven into the fabric of the story. Ana Luisa Ponsirenas, amateur cyclist, becomes a professional dreamer for a brief window each day. Tomorrow, the road will call her again.
