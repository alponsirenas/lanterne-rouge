# Stage 6 — Bayeux > Vire Normandie

*July 10, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas sets off from Bayeux, a solitary figure amidst a kaleidoscope of colors and spinning wheels. The hum of her indoor trainer beneath her, the digitized French countryside unfurls on her screen. Her heart rate, a steady 153.3 bpm, is a testament to her calculated approach. Today, she is not an audacious breakaway artist or a reckless sprinter. She is a GC contender, a role that indulges her love for strategy and psychological warfare. 

The virtual sun casts long shadows on the open roads of Normandy. Ana Luisa keeps her power output steady, maintaining her position in the peloton, allowing the breakaway to establish itself. She watches them, a handful of figures gradually fading into the distance. She notes their names, their teams, not for herself, but out of professional curiosity. They are not her concern today.

Her average power hovers around 102.2W, a tempo that feels comfortable. She's mindful of the grander scheme, the impending mountain stages, the inevitable time trials. Energy is a currency she must spend wisely over the next two weeks. 

Just 25km in, the breakaway solidifies, a day-long bid for glory. She lets them go, her place is in the main body of the Tour. Her focus is not on the breakaway but on her own measured cadence, on the rolling hills of Normandy that demand her thoughtful calculation. 

Ana Luisa is far removed from the heat of the sprint, the chaotic final rush for the line. When the news arrives that Ben Healy has taken the stage, she's not surprised. She remembers his fierce acceleration, the way he danced on the pedals, the way Normandy's hills seemed to bow to his will. 

Crossing the line in Vire Normandie, Ana Luisa is part of a larger organism. The peloton, still a compact entity, devoid of any real urgency. For her, this stage was not about winning, but about surviving, about understanding the ebb and flow of the race. 

With six stages now behind her, she allows herself a moment of self-reflection. She thinks about the tactical decisions she made during the stage, about the balance between aggression and patience. The Tour de France is a chess game on wheels, and Ana Luisa is learning to play it with increasing sophistication. 

In her mind, she's already preparing for the next stage, for the next set of calculations. The Tour waits for no one, and neither does Ana Luisa Ponsirenas. She is both a part of it and apart from it, a solitary figure in a sea of colors and spinning wheels. Another day, another stage, another story to be written. This is her Tour.
