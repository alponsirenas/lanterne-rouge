# Stage 10 — Ennezat > Le Mont-Dore Puy de Sancy

*July 14, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is a study in motion, her form a testament to countless hours in the saddle. She's a GC contender today, a silent observer in the heart of the peloton as it snakes its way through the undulating landscape of Ennezat. Today is not her day to break away, not yet. Today, she is here to learn, to understand, to calculate.

The peloton rolls out at minute zero, a vibrant, pulsating organism of color and power. Nestled within its core, Ana Luisa inhales deeply, her heart rate ticking up to a controlled 153 bpm – not a sprint, but a steady burn, a metronome set to the rhythm of the race. She's riding at threshold, her average power output a steady 113.8 watts, mirroring the effort of the main bunch. She's not yet reaching for victory, merely seeking to stay buoyant in the tactical tide.

She notes the day-long breakaway that forms 25 kilometers into the race, but she doesn't give chase. There's a wisdom in her restraint, a deep-seated understanding that the break will be reeled in, that the peloton dictates the tempo of the race. The breakaway is a mere diversion, a distraction. Ana Luisa refuses to be distracted.

As the kilometers unwind beneath her wheels, she doesn't surrender to the allure of the French countryside or the fervor of the roadside crowds. Her focus is on the intricate dance of the peloton, the subtle shifts in pace and position, the reactions to each other's moves. She's not just a participant; she's a spectator, a strategist. A chess game unfolds before her, and Ana Luisa is intent on deciphering its complex dynamics.

When Simon Yates crosses the line first in Le Mont-Dore Puy de Sancy at minute 247, Ana Luisa remains within the main bunch, her power output unvarying, her heart rate measured. Yates' victory is registered, assimilated into her ever-growing comprehension of the race. In the grand scheme of things, it's merely another move on the chessboard, another variable in the calculation.

At the close of the stage, Ana Luisa is exactly where she needs to be: within the peloton, her power output unwavering, her heart rate steady. She's navigated ten stages of the Tour, five of them back-to-back. She's not yet sprinting for victories. She's still studying, still tallying, still calculating. She's part of the peloton, part of the race. And for Ana Luisa, that's enough for now. Tomorrow brings another day, another stage, another move in the grand chess game that is the Tour de France.
