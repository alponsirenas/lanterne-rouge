# Stage 13 — Loudenvielle > Peyragudes

*July 18, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas begins her virtual journey from Loudenvielle, nestled within her own peloton. Her console reads a steady 114.6 watts - not her target FTP, but a dependable ally in this enduring simulation.

She observes the day-long breakaway establish itself, a specter in the pixelated landscape. It's a strategy she knows well, having assumed the role thrice in this tour. Today, she chooses to witness it from the relative safety of the main group.

Sixteen minutes in, "Tadej Pogacar" flashes across the screen. The Slovenian has claimed Peyragudes. But Ponsirenas, along with the rest of the peloton, remains in the purgatory between start and finish.

Her heart maintains a steady rhythm at 148.9 beats per minute, mirroring the fluid cadence of her pedaling. She has opted not to break away today. She's assessed the situation, measured the risk, and concluded that remaining with the main group is the most logical choice. It's a game of endurance, of surviving today to compete again tomorrow.

There's a peculiar solace in the monotony, the cyclic motion of legs and pedals against the backdrop of a simulated clear day. She reflects on the thirteen stages she's endured, the three consecutive days she's inhabited this world. The Tour de France, even in its virtual form, is as much a mental challenge as a physical one.

As Pogacar's victory is declared, she feels a familiar mix of admiration and envy. She's not here to win, she reminds herself. She's here for the experience, for the thrill of the pursuit and the satisfaction of knowing she can hold her own.

The stage concludes, the simulation fades. Ponsirenas slows to a halt, her breath uneven but controlled. She dismounts, her gaze still locked on the console.

Tomorrow, she'll begin anew. She'll react to the race dynamics, observe the breakaways form and dissolve, measure her effort against the relentless course. Today, she was a part of the peloton. Tomorrow, who can say? The beauty of the Tour de France lies in its unpredictability, its capacity to astonish and unsettle.

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas will return to the saddle, prepared for the next strategic move in this grand game.
