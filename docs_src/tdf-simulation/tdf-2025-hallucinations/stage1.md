# Stage 1 — Lille Métropole > Lille Métropole

*July 05, 2025*

⸻

From Lille Métropole, the journey begins for Ana Luisa Ponsirenas. The peloton hums in her ears, a rhythmic pulse against the backdrop of a partly cloudy day. She is already calculating the impact of the crosswinds on this first stage of the simulated Tour de France 2025.

Her ride is a chess game, a defensive strategy amidst the throng of cyclists. Her power hovers around 82.4 watts, heart rate steady at 140 beats per minute. Today, she is neither the breakaway artist nor the sprinter. She is the GC contender, the storm-rider.

The first crosswind hits like a slap, scattering the peloton like marbles on a cobblestone street. She clings to a domestique's slipstream, tucking herself in. Ana Luisa's Tour is not about individual stage victories, but about surviving the raw, frenetic theatre of pro racing.

A breakaway forms at 15 kilometers - Vercher, Rutsch, Le Berre, Armirail, Thomas. Their names ring out, a warning bell through the peloton. The game is afoot. Her wattage spikes, heart rate climbing as she fights to hold her position. The chaos of the peloton never fails to steal her breath.

The intermediate sprint at 87.5 kilometers is snatched by a fleeting Jonathan Milan, soon forgotten as the focus snaps back to the pulsating peloton. Her day is about rhythm, calculation, endurance. No surges, no key efforts. Just the relentless cycle of wheels and the ticking clock.

The route, a punishing 184.9 kilometers loop from Lille Métropole back to Lille Métropole, is a cycle of torment and triumph. The sprint finish sees Jasper Philipsen triumphant, his victory a spectacle against the backdrop of the city. Ana Luisa finishes within the main bunch, her goal for the day achieved. She has weathered the echelons that split the peloton, costing Evenepoel, Roglic, and Lipowitz precious seconds, through sheer determination and a deep understanding of the capricious winds.

As she cools down, her breath heavy but steady, Ana Luisa reflects on her day's ride. Her satisfaction lies in the journey, in the raw, thrilling test of the Tour de France.

Tomorrow, she will ride again. Another day, another stage. Her tale is yet to be finished. The Tour is long, its siren song echoing in the quiet corners of her mind. Ana Luisa Ponsirenas, the amateur cyclist, a contender every day, a survivor every day. She signs off with a weary smile. Tomorrow awaits.
