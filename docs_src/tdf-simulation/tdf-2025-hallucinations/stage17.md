# Stage 17 — Bollène > Valence

*July 23, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas, a mere speck of color amidst the peloton's clamor, embarks from Bollène. The sun, a sharp, unyielding entity in the sky, reflects the unwavering clarity of her purpose. She is not here for the sprint, the breakaway, or to seize the victory that will ultimately belong to Jonathan Milan. Ana Luisa is the heartbeat of the peloton, a GC contender caught in the cerebral game of professional cycling.

Ahead lies 160.4 kilometers of strategic exertion. Her legs, metronomes of measured force, maintain a steady power output of 91 watts. It's a test, not a battle. Her heart, a drum beating out a rhythm of 139 bpm, echoes her resolve. Today, she is not a combatant, but a spectator, an analyst. This is her approach to the Tour de France 2025. This is her 17th stage of the simulation, another notch in her belt of growth, marked not by victories but by personal evolution.

At the fifty-minute mark, the landscape shifts. A climb, a tangible change in the atmosphere as the peloton's rhythm adjusts. Fifty kilometers from the finish, the GC contenders launch their attack, transforming the race into a skirmish. Ana Luisa, observing from her steady position, feels a flicker of adrenaline. She could join them, surge ahead with a burst of power... but she won't. Her mission today is survival, conservation, endurance.

The race's pulse accelerates, but Ana Luisa's remains constant. She watches as the lead riders break away, their forms receding into the distance. Their victory is not hers, but their struggle is. A shared purpose that unites every rider, every heartbeat in this fluid entity known as the peloton.

Valence looms, the terminus of today's journey. Jonathan Milan crosses the line in victory. Amidst the main bunch, Ana Luisa senses the resonance of his triumph in her own accomplishment. She has endured, powered through another stage of the Tour de France simulation. The end is near, but it's not the finish line that captivates her. It's the road she's traversed, the wealth of experience she's amassed, and the anticipation of the stages yet to unfold. 

This is her Tour. Each pedal stroke, each heartbeat, a testament to her journey. The rider, Ana Luisa Ponsirenas, remains a constant in the whirlwind, a testament to endurance and the understated power of persistence.
