# Stage 15 — Muret > Carcassonne

*July 20, 2025*

⸻

In the 2025 virtual Tour de France, Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is a mere pixel among many, a digital rider in a virtual peloton. Yet, on her indoor trainer, she is a living, breathing part of the race, her rhythm and cadence synchronised with the others. The stage from Muret to Carcassonne, a 175-kilometre mountainous challenge, unfolds before her in crisp, digital detail.

Ana finds her place in the heart of the peloton, conserving energy, her gaze shifting between the screen and the power counter under her handlebars. 115.0W, as steady as a metronome. She imagines the other riders, their silence a shared resolve. Identified only by numbers and a small blue dot on a map, they form a united front against the stage’s demands.

The attack comes at the 50-kilometre mark, a sudden surge through the group. GC contenders break away on the climb, a wave of power Ana observes but does not follow. She knows her limits, her heart rate steady at 154.5 bpm. Her ride is a calm calculation. She is not the hare in this race, but the tortoise.

The kilometres unravel beneath her, a tapestry woven with patience and effort. Ana observes her rivals, speculates on their tactics. She feels the burn in her legs, the dryness in her throat. Yet, there’s satisfaction too, a sense of achievement with each pedal stroke. This is her fifteenth stage, four days of matching wits and watts with the virtual world.

News of Tim Wellens's victory reaches her. Ana crosses the line in Carcassonne, lost in the anonymous mass of the peloton. She’s not a stage winner, but a survivor. A player in a grand chess game that spans three weeks and countless kilometres.

The stage ends, but the Tour persists. Ana wipes sweat from her brow, her heart still pounding a victory drum in her chest. She’s a small part of a larger narrative, a pixelated rider in a digital Tour. But on her indoor trainer, she’s the protagonist of her own story, living each stage as part of the peloton's world. Tomorrow, she’ll ride again.
