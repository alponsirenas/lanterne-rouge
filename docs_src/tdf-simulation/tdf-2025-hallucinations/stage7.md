*July 11, 2025*

In Saint-Malo, it's the zero hour. The peloton, a pulsating organism of lycra and carbon, begins its journey. Ana Luisa Ponsirenas, an experienced player in this game, is nestled within its core. Each start line is a rebirth, a fresh anticipation. Her heart rate, 138.4 bpm, is a silent testament to the duel of body and mind.

The kilometres, like time, slip away. Ana Luisa is a portrait of patience, her power output a steady 89.9W. She's both a part of the peloton and apart from it, a solitary figure in a swirling, chaotic ballet. Today, she's a GC contender, her mission to conserve, calculate, observe.

At the 25.0km mark, a breakaway takes shape. Ana Luisa watches, her gaze following their flight. She knows them, their strengths, their frailties. But she remains, her place is within the peloton's rhythm, its predictable cadence. A breakaway is a gamble, a game of chance. Not today. Today is about survival, about reaching Mûr-de-Bretagne Guerlédan unscathed.

The peloton, like a cat toying with its prey, reels in the breakaway. Ana Luisa is there, a silent witness to the race's merciless dynamics. She considers the power she's conserved, the energy she's saved. These are her victories, the ones that go unnoticed.

Minute 262, and Tadej Pogacar breaks away from the pack, his triumph a testament to power, strategy, and indomitable will. Ana Luisa crosses the line at her own rhythm, the taste of exertion lingering, relief washing over her like a summer rain. She has survived another stage, earned the right to face tomorrow.

The stage ends, but the Tour persists. Ana Luisa steals a moment to breathe, to savour the calm before the storm of the next stage. Seven out of twenty-one stages completed, a third of the journey traversed. She contemplates the stages to come, the challenges they'll present. She's not here to win the Tour, but to endure it, to decipher its complexities and emerge transformed.

She knows there will be days of struggle, of pain. But there will also be days of triumph, days when she'll feel invincible. She's riding not just for the competition, not just for the physical challenge, but for the mental one too. She's riding to understand what it means to push beyond limits, to face fear and fatigue and emerge victorious. The Tour is more than a race, it's a journey. And Ana Luisa Ponsirenas, seasoned amateur cyclist, is ready for the ride.
