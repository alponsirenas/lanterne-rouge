# Stage 12 — Auch > Hautacam

*July 17, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas rolls out from Auch, the peloton heavy with anticipation that thickens the morning air. The stage ahead is a mountain climb, 180.6 kilometers to Hautacam. The sky is clear, and a hum of restlessness vibrates through the riders. 

Ponsirenas settles in, her legs moving in sync with her heart rate, a steady 152.7 bpm. She's not part of the early breakaway - a cluster of ambitious riders that peel away around the 25-kilometer mark. Instead, she's holding back, a GC contender playing a long game. Her average power, a steady 113.1W, is a testament to her tactical restraint. 

The breakaway riders surge ahead, the gap between them and the peloton gradually widening. Ponsirenas watches them, an experienced chess player observing an opponent's aggressive opening move. She knows there's a long way to go, and today, patience is her strategy.

Around her, the peloton moves with a collective rhythm, like a single organism stretching its limbs across the tarmac. There's a lull before the storm, before the road begins to climb and the real battle commences. Ponsirenas maintains her position, her mind as steady as her power output.

The breakaway is reeled in by the peloton, their early ambition quashed by the relentless pace of the main group. Ponsirenas is still there, still steady, still measuring her efforts like a careful strategist.

Then, it happens. The road tilts upwards, and the climb to Hautacam begins. Ponsirenas feels the gradient bite into her legs, and she adjusts her effort, the numbers on her power meter ticking higher. Tadej Pogacar, the stage's eventual winner, surges ahead, leading the charge up the mountain. Ponsirenas doesn't follow. Not today. Today, she has her own rhythm, her own pace.

The finish line comes into view, a welcome sight after the grueling ascent. Ponsirenas crosses it, the line etched in the road marking the end of another day of racing. Another battle fought, another stage completed.

She reflects on her ride, not with regret or disappointment, but with satisfaction. A satisfaction that comes from knowing she's ridden her own race, that she's played her part in the grand chess game that is the Tour de France. And tomorrow, she'll do it all again. This is her story, her race. Her Tour de France.
