# Stage 19 — Albertville > La Plagne

*July 26, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is a quiet presence at the back of the peloton, the drone of rubber on rollers her only company. It's the 19th stage of her virtual Tour de France, a digital echo of the 2025 race. The simulated route, a brief but brutal 93.1 km mountain stage from Albertville to La Plagne, transforms her living room into a theatre of mental chess and strategic manoeuvres.

Her heart ticks away at a steady 135.7 bpm, a living metronome against the rhythm of her effort. An average power of 99.3W hums in her legs, anchoring her to the Alpine landscape unfurling on the screen. As a protected GC rider, she's insulated from the frenzied scramble that typically marks the start of a stage; she's here to endure, not to dominate. Yet, an undercurrent of tension persists, a subconscious tally of energy spent, gears selected, decisions made. The chess match she's so often analysed, now playing out beneath her.

At the 50 km mark, the GC contenders make their move. It's a sudden, violent surge of power, a shockwave that shudders through the peloton. Ponsirenas registers it, studies it. A decision looms: respond or hold steady. She opts for the latter. Her effort remains constant, her pedal strokes unchanging. She observes the attack unfold, the gap grow. A part of her yearns to join, to match their power, their tempo. But she understands her limits, recognises the peril of overreaching. It's not in the numbers, the watts or the heart rate. It's in the ride's texture, the intimate comprehension of one's capabilities and constraints.

She watches Thymen Arensman break away, his virtual avatar darting up the mountain. Ponsirenas recognises this from her study of the sport, the audacity of a successful breakaway. The Dutchman crosses the finish line at La Plagne, a triumphant silhouette against the clear sky, while Ponsirenas remains somewhere behind him, nestled in the peloton's belly.

The finish line passes beneath her, both a relief and a victory. She is not Arensman, not a stage winner, but that's not her fight. Hers is the silent struggle of the domestique, the peloton's unsung hero. She's completed 19 stages, each one a testament to her resilience. The achievement isn't in the winning, but in the enduring.

As the virtual Alps dissolve from her screen, Ponsirenas settles into stillness. Her heartbeat slows, her breath steadies. The chess match is paused, the calculations set aside. She's one stage away from the finish line in Paris. The thought stirs a mix of apprehension and anticipation. This is the Tour's reality, a bitter-sweet symphony of exhaustion and exhilaration.

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is not merely riding the Tour; she is living it, feeling it, weaving herself into its complex tapestry. She is not a spectator, but a participant in the grand chess game of cycling.
