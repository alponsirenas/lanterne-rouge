# Stage 19 — Albertville > La Plagne

*July 25, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is once again astride her bike, her fingers lightly brushing the handlebars. The drone of her indoor trainer merges with the remote cheers of virtual spectators in Albertville. The 19th stage of the Tour de France 2025 simulation is underway. She's not here to claim victory, but to experience the race in its raw, unfiltered form.

The peloton unfurls, a vibrant, writhing mass against the backdrop of a cloudless sky. Ana Luisa blends into the main group. As a GC contender, she's mastered the art of energy conservation, of tactical riding. She sails along the flat sections, her heart rate a consistent 141.5 bpm, power averaging around 107.8W. It's a delicate balance of endurance, understanding her FTP, and recognizing her body's limits.

The kilometres dissolve. The peloton is a living entity, and she's merely a cell within it. Watching, calculating, she's a gear in the complex machinery of the peloton’s psyche. Around the 50km mark, she observes the GC contenders launch their attack on the climb. The peloton fractures, riders scattering along the mountainside. Adrenaline surges, but she remains composed, mindful of her role - observer, tactician, a player in the long game.

The climb persists, the gradient unforgiving. She synchronizes her cadence with the rhythm of the road, each pedal stroke a repeated mantra of resilience. Her legs scream, her breath comes in ragged gasps. These are the moments she savours, her own strength reflected in the simulated world.

The mountain stage finish in La Plagne looms. Thymen Arensman breaks away, securing his victory and etching his name into the annals of the Tour's history. Ana Luisa crosses the line amidst the stragglers, her mission fulfilled.

This is her 19th stage, a testament to her tenacity, a homage to her passion for cycling. She's not merely a spectator in the grand theatre of professional cycling; she's an active participant, feeling the race's pulse, the agony and the ecstasy, the thrill and the despair.

She dismounts, legs weary but spirit rejuvenated. Tomorrow, she will ride again, penning another chapter in her Tour de France simulation, another brushstroke in the canvas of her life on the bike. Not for victory, not for glory, but for the love of the ride, for the intricate ballet of strategy and endurance, for the silent dialogues with herself amidst the race's heat.

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is not simply riding the Tour de France. She's living it.
