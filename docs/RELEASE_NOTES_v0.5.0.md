## üîã Power-Based Analysis System (v0.5.0 Update)

### Scientific Training Load Assessment
- **Intensity Factor (IF)**: Normalized Power √∑ FTP for accurate relative effort assessment
- **Training Stress Score (TSS)**: Duration √ó IF¬≤ √ó 100 for quantified training load
- **Effort Level Classification**: Automatic power zone categorization (recovery/aerobic/tempo/threshold/vo2max/neuromuscular)
- **FTP Integration**: All calculations relative to athlete's Functional Threshold Power (128W)

### LLM-Powered Activity Analysis
- **Power-First Approach**: Prioritizes IF, TSS, and Normalized Power over subjective metrics
- **Intelligent Context Analysis**: LLM evaluates power metrics with stage type and strategic considerations
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI provides confidence levels and performance indicators
- **Enhanced Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all LLM interactions

### Smart Ride Mode Classification
**Breakaway Mode (Aggressive)**:
- IF ‚â• 0.85 (Zone 4+ effort)
- TSS ‚â• 60 (High training load)
- Strategy: High-intensity effort pushing physiological limits

**GC Mode (Conservative)**:
- IF ‚â• 0.70 (Zone 3+ effort)
- TSS ‚â• 40 (Moderate training load)
- Strategy: Sustainable effort focused on consistent completion

**Rest Mode (Recovery)**:
- IF < 0.70 (Zone 1-2 effort)
- TSS < 40 (Low training load)
- Strategy: Active recovery or very easy effort

### Post-Stage LLM Evaluation
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Strategic performance evaluation with recovery recommendations
- **Campaign Strategy**: Advice for upcoming stages considering current fitness state
- **Personalized Motivation**: Encouraging, context-aware communication
- **Training Load Management**: TSS-based recovery guidance and strategic planning

### Enhanced Fallback System
- **Rule-Based Power Analysis**: When LLM unavailable, uses power-based classification rules
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintains scientific accuracy even without LLM
- **Suffer Score Fallback**: Only used when power data is insufficient
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching with detailed logging

### Configuration Enhancements
```toml
# Power-based thresholds in missions/tdf_sim_2025.toml
[athlete]
ftp = 128  # Functional Threshold Power for all calculations

[tdf_simulation.detection]
breakaway_intensity_threshold = 0.85  # IF for breakaway classification
breakaway_tss_threshold = 60          # TSS for breakaway classification
gc_intensity_threshold = 0.70         # IF for GC classification
gc_tss_threshold = 40                 # TSS for GC classification
fallback_suffer_threshold = 100       # Fallback when power unavailable
```

### Technical Implementation
- **Power Metrics Calculation**: New `calculate_power_metrics()` function in validation.py
- **Enhanced Activity Analysis**: Updated `analyze_activity_with_llm()` with power-first approach
- **Validation Layer**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **LLM Integration**: Seamless integration with existing AI client infrastructure
