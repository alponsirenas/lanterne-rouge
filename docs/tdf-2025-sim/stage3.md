🏆 Breakaway Mode

“Jump in the early break, push hard whenever the crosswind sections appear, try to hold off the charging peloton until the last kilometers.”
	•	Start aggressive, fight to get away.
	•	Sustained high effort through the wind-prone midsection—imagine forming or responding to echelons.
	•	Short, sharp blocks for “holding the gap” under pressure.
	•	Finish with a last push or ease up when caught, then roll in.

🦺 GC Mode

	•	One or two periods of higher intensity when the bunch splits.
	•	Quickly settle down once the danger passes, and ride in for the finish.
