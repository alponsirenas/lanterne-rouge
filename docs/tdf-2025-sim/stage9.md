🚴 Stage 9 — Blois → Orléans (2025)

Profile Summary & Tactical Story
	•	Terrain: Flat, likely crosswinds in the Loire valley. A classic “nervous” stage—exposed roads mean the peloton could split into echelons.
	•	Race Narrative:
	•	Early: Nervous start, everyone wants front position.
	•	Mid: Crosswind zones may break up the race, hard efforts to get in the right group.
	•	Finale: Sprinters’ teams try to bring it back, but splits may stick.
	•	Sporting Stakes:
	•	Time gaps possible if splits happen, sprint points, breakaways often doomed.
