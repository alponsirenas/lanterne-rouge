🚴 Stage 5 — ITT

Profile Summary & Tactical Story
	•	Terrain: Flat to gently rolling, short time trial (think ~30 km in the real Tour).
	•	Race Narrative:
	•	No breakaways—just you against the clock.
	•	For GC: Ride at steady high tempo, but don’t go into the red unless you’re a TT specialist.
	•	For Breakaway: “Pretend you’re the wildcard—take risks, try to post a heroic time, ignore tomorrow’s fatigue.”
	•	Sporting Stakes: GC time gaps possible, TT specialists chase glory.
