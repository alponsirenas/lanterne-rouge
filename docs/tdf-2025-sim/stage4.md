Here we go—Stage 4 in the new “Tour de France Lived Experience” format!

⸻

🚴 Stage 4 — Cognac → Angoulême (2025)

Profile Summary & Tactical Story
	•	Terrain: Rolling, classic breakaway stage with three short categorized climbs, no long mountains.
	•	Race Narrative:
	•	Early flat = break forms, peloton not too interested.
	•	Climbs come in the middle third—opportunity for points and break-splitting attacks.
	•	Last third: rolling/false flat, break fights for survival, solo attempts possible.
	•	If the break gets caught late, the pace drops—otherwise, it’s all-out to the line.
	•	Sporting Stakes: KOM points mid-stage, possible sprint bonuses, small time gaps possible.
