🚴 Stage 7 — Mûr-de-Bretagne “Punchy Finale” Stage

Profile Summary & Tactical Story
	•	Terrain: Hilly, undulating stage with a steep uphill finish (Mûr-de-Bretagne) that favors explosive puncheurs and aggressive breakaways.
	•	Race Narrative:
	•	Early: Break forms on rolling terrain.
	•	Middle: Series of short climbs; peloton lets the break go, but GC teams ride defensively.
	•	Finale: The steep Mûr-de-Bretagne (often twice in the final 20 km) – a brutal punchy finish with attacks from GC and breakaway survivors.
	•	Sporting Stakes: KOM/sprint points mid-stage, and possible small GC time gaps on the finale.
