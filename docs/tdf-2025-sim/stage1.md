🚴 Stage 1 — Lille → Paris (Hypothetical)

Profile Summary & Tactical Story
	•	Terrain: Pan-flat, urban start, straight roads with only minor undulations.
	•	Race Narrative:
	•	Early: Fast and nervous, everyone wants to avoid crashes, but the break goes quickly.
	•	Mid: Long, steady chase—sprinters’ teams control the tempo, break is allowed some freedom.
	•	Finale: High speed, wide roads, “trains” form for the big bunch sprint.
	•	Sporting Stakes: First yellow jersey, sprinters’ pride, everyone wants to avoid losing time.

🏆 Breakaway Mode

“Go from the gun, fight to make the break, drive hard until caught near the finish, maybe dream of a miracle.”
	•	Warm-up and initial surges as the break forms on flat roads.
	•	Extended high-tempo pulls as the breakaway works together to build a gap.
	•	Occasional Z4 surges to simulate TV time and KOM/sprint points, plus brief spells of recovery.
	•	The intensity ramps again for the imagined “final push” before the sprinters’ teams reel you in.
	•	Survive, then spin it out with the peloton at the end.

🦺 GC Mode

“Stay protected in the peloton, minimize risk, let the sprinters and breakaway specialists play.”
	•	Long, controlled tempo at Z2–low Z3, shielded by teammates.
	•	Only one or two brief moments of harder effort—responding to a split or late crash.
	•	Emphasis is on smooth pedaling, saving energy, and staying out of trouble.
	•	Cool down with the group after the finish.
