🚴 Stage 8 — Fougères → Le Mans (2025)

Profile Summary & Tactical Story
	•	Terrain: Classic flat sprinter’s stage—long, mostly flat roads, some gentle undulations, but minimal climbing.
	•	Race Narrative:
	•	Early: Break goes, peloton controls, not much urgency.
	•	Mid: The break gets a leash; some minor surges for intermediate sprints.
	•	Finale: All about the run-in to a bunch sprint, with a few minutes of chaos at the end!
	•	Sporting Stakes:
	•	Sprint points, small breakaway glory, but high odds for a peloton finish.
