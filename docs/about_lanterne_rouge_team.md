# About the Team

This project is built by a modular, mission-driven team — part human, part AI.

In this experiment, I play the role of Product Strategist, defining the mission, vision, and user outcomes for the system. From there, the idea is that a team of specialized AI agents handles everything from architecture to development to interface design.


## Current Team Members

### **Product Strategist**
- Define the mission and system goals
- Prioritize milestones (like v0.3.0)
- Coordinate the AI team and reflect across workstreams

### **AI Systems Architect**
- Designs the system structure and agent interactions
- Maintains modular boundaries between agents
- Plans for future orchestration and autonomy

### **Agent Developer**
- Implements core logic for reasoning, observation, planning, and more
- Runs the simulation and writes training decisions to memory
- Builds toward mission-locked daily coaching

### **UX Designer**
- Explores and designs how the insights provided by Lanterne Rouge can become part of the users day-to-day activities.
- Focuses on transparency, trust, and low-friction experiences
- Iterates on how decisions are shown and explained

### **LLM Integration Engineer**
- Crafts the prompts that generate natural language coaching summaries
- Integrates the language model into the daily decision loop
- Tunes output to be empathetic, clear, and consistent

## Why Use AI Agents?

This is an experiment in what it means to build AI with AI. Each agent operates in its own thread of thought, maintains its own memory, and contributes as a specialist. Together, they simulate a real product team — with parallel development, asynchronous collaboration, and role-based expertise.

I serve as the product strategist and coordinator, defining the high-level goals and guiding collaboration. But much of the work — code, ideas, documentation — is generated with or by the agents.

This project is both a testbed for coaching and a blueprint for how we might build AI systems in the future: with modular agents, transparent workflows, and shared memory.
