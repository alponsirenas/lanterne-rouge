# About the Team

This project is built by a modular, mission-driven team — part human, part AI.

In this experiment, I play the role of Product Strategist, defining the mission, vision, and user outcomes for the system. From there, the idea is that a team of specialized AI agents handles everything from architecture to development to interface design.


## Current Team Members

### **Product Strategist**
- Define the mission and system goals
- Prioritize milestones (like v0.3.0)
- Coordinate the AI team and reflect across workstreams

### **AI Systems Architect**
- Designs the system structure and agent interactions
- Maintains modular boundaries between agents
- Plans for future orchestration and autonomy

### **Agent Developer**
- Implements core logic for reasoning, observation, planning, and more
- Runs the simulation and writes training decisions to memory
- Builds toward mission-locked daily coaching

### **UX Designer**
- Explores and designs how the insights provided by Lanterne Rouge can become part of the users day-to-day activities.
- Focuses on transparency, trust, and low-friction experiences
- Iterates on how decisions are shown and explained

### **LLM Integration Engineer**
- Crafts the prompts that generate natural language coaching summaries
- Integrates the language model into the daily decision loop
- Tunes output to be empathetic, clear, and consistent

### **Documentation Specialist**
- Reviews and updates project documentation
- Ensures accuracy and clarity of all written materials
- Coordinates with team members to gather necessary information

## Why Use AI Agents?

This is an experiment in what it means to build AI with AI. Each agent operates in its own thread of thought, maintains its own memory, and contributes as a specialist. Together, they simulate a real product team — with parallel development, asynchronous collaboration, and role-based expertise.

I serve as the product strategist and coordinator, defining the high-level goals and guiding collaboration. But much of the work — code, ideas, documentation — is generated with or by the agents.

This project is both a testbed for coaching and a blueprint for how we might build AI systems in the future: with modular agents, transparent workflows, and shared memory.

## Documentation Review Process

To ensure that our documentation remains accurate and up-to-date, we follow a structured review process. This process involves regular reviews, updates, and approvals to maintain the quality and relevance of our documentation.

### Steps for Reviewing and Updating Documentation

1. **Identify Documentation to Review**: Determine which documents need to be reviewed based on project milestones, changes in the system, or feedback from team members.

2. **Assign Reviewers**: Assign team members or GPT instances to review the identified documents. Ensure that reviewers have the necessary domain knowledge and context.

3. **Review and Annotate**: Reviewers should thoroughly read the documents, annotate any discrepancies, outdated information, or areas that need clarification.

4. **Update Content**: Based on the annotations, update the content to reflect the latest information, changes, and improvements. Ensure that the updates are clear, concise, and accurate.

5. **Approval and Integration**: Once the updates are made, the revised documents should be reviewed and approved by the Product Owner or designated approver. After approval, integrate the updated documents into the project repository.

6. **Communicate Changes**: Notify the team about the updated documentation and highlight any significant changes or new information.

7. **Regular Review Cycle**: Establish a regular review cycle (e.g., quarterly) to ensure that documentation remains current and relevant. Schedule periodic reviews and updates as part of the project workflow.

By following this process, we ensure that our documentation remains a valuable resource for the team, providing accurate and up-to-date information to support the development and maintenance of the Lanterne Rouge project.
