# Lanterne Rouge Training Strategy

## Training Philosophy

Endurance is built through intelligent, consistent stress and recovery cycles.  
Lanterne Rouge promotes finishing strong, not burning out, via:

- Cumulative fatigue tolerance
- Specific energy system development
- Adaptation to real-world readiness and recovery signals

## Periodization Approach

- **Build Phase** (Marchâ€“May):
  - Increase base volume
  - Introduce threshold intervals
- **Peak Phase** (June):
  - Focus on climbing simulations and back-to-back fatigue management.
- **Taper Phase** (late June):
  - Reduce volume, sharpen specificity, optimize freshness.

## Adaptation Principles

- Readiness Scores and TSB inform day-to-day load adjustments.
- MissionConfig goals (e.g., stage types, event dates) always locked.
- Dynamic daily decisions adjust volume, intensity, and recovery insertion.

## Reflection (Future Work)

- Evaluate weekly adaptation trends.
- Auto-modify future microblocks if fatigue deviates significantly from plan.
