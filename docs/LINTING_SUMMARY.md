# Lanterne Rouge Core Module Linting Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the linting improvements made to the core modules of the Lanterne Rouge project. The code quality rating improved from approximately 8.73/10 to 9.24/10.

## Major Improvements

### 1. Import Organization
- Removed unused imports in multiple modules
- Fixed import order to follow standard practice (standard libraries first, then third-party, then local)
- Resolved import issues in plan_generator.py to prevent circular imports

### 2. Code Structure
- Fixed unnecessary `elif/else` after `return` statements in reasoner.py and strava_api.py
- Improved function signatures to clarify parameter usage
- Added parameter type annotations in monitor.py for environment variable handling

### 3. Error Handling
- Replaced broad Exception catches with more specific exceptions in monitor.py and ai_clients.py
- Added timeout parameters to all network requests in strava_api.py to prevent program hangs
- Improved error message clarity

### 4. Code Quality
- Fixed file encoding issues by specifying UTF-8 in open() calls
- Removed trailing whitespace in multiple files
- Fixed line length issues by breaking long lines into multiline statements
- Added clarifying comments for unused but required parameters

## Module-Specific Changes

### ai_clients.py
- Improved exception handling with specific exception types
- Fixed import and dependency issues

### monitor.py
- Fixed environment variable handling to properly handle default values
- Improved readiness score handling as a scalar value
- Improved formatting of debug messages for better readability

### plan_generator.py
- Fixed circular import issues
- Moved imports to module level
- Improved parameter handling in legacy function

### reasoner.py
- Fixed unnecessary conditionals after return statements
- Improved multi-line formatting for better readability
- Added comments explaining unused parameters

### strava_api.py
- Added timeout parameters to all network requests
- Fixed encoding issues in file operations
- Improved import order (standard libraries first)
- Removed unnecessary conditionals

### tour_coach.py
- Removed unused imports
- Improved code structure and readability

## Remaining Issues

While significant improvements were made, the following issues remain:

1. **Line Length**: Some modules still have lines exceeding 100 characters
2. **Function Complexity**: Some functions still have too many arguments, local variables, or branches
3. **Classes with Too Few Methods**: Some classes still have only one public method
4. **Global Variables**: The strava_api.py module still uses global variables extensively

These issues would require more substantial refactoring and could be addressed in future iterations.

## Conclusion

The core modules of Lanterne Rouge have been significantly improved with better code organization, error handling, and adherence to Python coding standards. The changes preserve functionality while making the code more maintainable and robust.
