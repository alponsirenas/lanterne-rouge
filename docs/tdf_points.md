# 🏆 Lanterne Rouge Tour Simulation — Points Guide

Welcome to the **Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025**. This isn’t just about finishing — it’s about how you ride.

With each stage, you’ll earn points based on the mode you complete:
- **GC Mode** rewards consistency and completion.
- **Breakaway Mode** rewards boldness and variability.

You can switch modes day-to-day — but the total score reflects your strategy, resilience, and tactical bravery.

## 🎯 How the Points System Works

### ✅ 1. Choose a Mode Each Day
- **GC Mode**: Ride smart. Ride steady. You’re aiming to complete the full tour with consistent CTL progression.
- **Breakaway Mode**: Simulate race-shaping efforts, punchy surges, and KOM/sprint action. Higher effort = higher reward.
