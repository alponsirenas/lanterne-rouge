# About the Project
**Lanterne Rouge: An AI-First Coaching System for Endurance Athletes**

*Lanterne Rouge* is a project that began with a question:  
**What if your training plan adjusted itself every day — based on how you feel, how you’ve performed, and where you’re headed?**

It’s named after the last rider in the Tour de France — the one who finishes against all odds, not the one who finishes fastest.

## What We’re Building

We’re building a mission-aware, adaptive coaching system powered by AI. It observes, reasons, plans, and reflects — just like a good coach should.

- It pulls data from sources like Oura and Strava.
- It makes daily training decisions: push, ease, or recover.
- It updates your training plan based on trends and readiness.
- It explains itself using natural language, with help from an LLM.
- It logs memory and prepares to reflect on how it’s doing.

The system is modular and agentic. Each function (reasoning, planning, communication, etc.) is handled by a specialized agent — and those agents are being built by a small AI product team… which is also made of AI agents.

## Why We’re Building It

This is an exploration of:
- **How AI can support long-term training, not just optimize for speed**
- **How to design tools that adapt with you, not just serve you**
- **What happens when you build AI with AI — and they learn together**

---

## Core Principles

- **Mission-Locked Reasoning** — All decisions connect back to your goal
- **Transparency** — You should always know *why* it made a decision
- **Modularity** — Each agent can evolve without breaking the others
- **Reflection-First** — The system learns from its past
- **Low Friction** — It should integrate with your real-world workflow

---

## Current Status

We’re currently in **v0.3.0**, focused on:
- Defining the mission structure
- Daily reasoning based on recovery, training stress, and trends
- Generating coaching summaries using LLMs
- Logging memory for future reflection

---

## Built With

- Python + Gradio
- Oura + Strava data APIs
- OpenAI and Anthropic LLMs
- A modular agent-based architecture

---

## What’s Next

- Smarter planning
- Long-term memory and adaptation
- Simulation of full multi-stage events
- A fully autonomous, explainable, coach-in-your-pocket

Let’s see what it means to go the distance — with a system that’s training to go with you.
