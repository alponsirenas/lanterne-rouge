# Tour de France Indoor Simulation — Event Structure

## Overview

- **Name**: Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025
- **Dates**: July 5 – July 27, 2025
- **Objective**: Complete a full 3-week simulated Tour experience with cumulative fatigue, climbing stages, threshold efforts, and recovery management.

## Stage Profiles

- **Climbing Stages**:
  - Long climbs requiring Zone 3–4 sustained efforts.
  - Example: 60 min climbs, 3–4% simulated grades.

- **Endurance Stages**:
  - Long Zone 2 efforts simulating breakaway management or peloton riding.
  - Example: 90 min endurance rides.

- **Threshold Stages**:
  - Shorter but intense Zone 4–5 intervals simulating attacks or time trials.

## Demands

- Daily accumulated fatigue simulation.
- Managing readiness under consecutive stress days.
- Prioritization of critical climbing simulations.

## Event Success Criteria

- Maintain CTL above ~70 starting the event.
- Sustain reasonable TSB levels without major breakdown.
- Complete key stage simulations even under fatigue.
