Riding Inside the Story: Fiction Mode for My Tour de France Simulation

Most training platforms give you numbers—watts, heartbeats, TSS—but what if every ride felt like a chapter in the Tour’s true drama? What if, instead of just logging another workout, you could see yourself racing in the peloton, fighting the wind, and living the day’s big moments alongside the pros?

That’s the vision for “Fiction Mode.”

How It Works
	•	I ride each Tour de France stage as an indoor simulation, matching the day’s real route, terrain, and objectives.
	•	After each stage, I export my ride data (power, heart rate, cadence, intervals) from my trainer or app.
	•	I pull the official Tour de France race report and highlights for that day—key events, attacks, breakaways, sprints, crashes, and who won.
	•	With both sources in hand, I use AI to map my real effort onto the day’s actual race story—placing myself (truthfully but imaginatively) inside the dynamics, tactics, and big moments of the World Tour.
	•	The result: a race narrative blending my data with the Tour’s events.
I become part of the break, survive crosswinds, or find myself protected in the bunch, my own efforts woven into the real timeline of the stage.

Why Tim Krabbé? Why The Rider?

Cycling is more than numbers. It’s mind games, loneliness, memory, calculation, and grace under pressure—the atmosphere captured so perfectly by Tim Krabbé in his cult-classic novel, The Rider.
Krabbé’s voice is sharp, wry, observant; his storytelling moves between the math of cycling and the mysterious motives that push us to ride.

By choosing Krabbé’s narrative style, I wanted each stage to feel like a lived day in the peloton—not just a workout, but an existential adventure.
The writing is spare and honest: sometimes detached, sometimes raw, always tuned to the inner life of a cyclist. Through this lens, my efforts and struggles are woven into the Tour’s daily theater, so that every session becomes both a physical and narrative journey.
