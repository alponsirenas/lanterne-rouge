“Van der Poel Keeps the Dream Going”

⸻

Rain on carbon and nerves. Ana Luisa rides with the peloton, her cadence set like a metronome—steady, unhurried, immune to the promise and threat of wet tarmac. The day starts cautiously; nobody wants to be the first to fall. The peloton smells of rain jackets and resolve.

At the first corner, a break goes, anonymous, doomed. The peloton lets them hover. Ana Luisa is content to watch the numbers, the rolling average of her effort, the smoothness of her line. Eighty-five watts, rarely more. Behind her visor, the world narrows: white road, dark sky, occasional movement at the front—nothing that requires her attention.

Mid-stage, the break is reeled in—no heroics, no disaster, just the slow, indifferent will of the group. Attack, be caught; repeat. She feels no call to arms, only the need to stay upright, to preserve something for days that matter.

Twenty kilometers from the finish, the pace rises. There is shouting at the front, teams fan out across the road. The rain returns, slicking the asphalt, sharpening every swerve. Mathieu van der Poel, somewhere out of sight, jumps. The move is decisive, unexpected. Ana Luisa sees the peloton stretch, senses the hope and panic traveling backwards, ripple-like, through the group.

She doesn’t chase. That isn’t her job, not today. Ewan and Merlier sprint from the pack, hunting seconds, but Van der Poel’s gamble pays off—he claims the day by a margin you could measure in heartbeats.

Ana Luisa arrives in the mass, face unmarked by effort or disappointment. Another day survived, another chance stored away for the mountains or the time trial, when calculation and courage might be required. For now, she is content to be a footnote in someone else’s headline, a shadow in the peloton, invisible and undefeated.

Tomorrow, the road will rise. The story will shift. She is patient.
