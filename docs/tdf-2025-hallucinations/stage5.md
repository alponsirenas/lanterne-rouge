# Stage 5 — Caen > Caen

*July 09, 2025*

⸻

Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is nestled within the peloton, a carbon and sweat-fueled organism that breathes and calculates, threading its way through the flatlands around Caen. The sun is an ally today, casting elongated shadows of riders across the tarmac.

In the pulsating heart of this entity, Ana Luisa labours. Her heart beats a steady 140 per minute, her legs spinning a rhythm of power. It's a tempo nurtured through countless hours on the trainer, a hum of effort that's quantifiable, sustainable—101.0 watts average, she notes with a hint of irony.

At the 25.0-kilometre mark, the breakaway forms like a sudden epiphany. A twitch in the peloton's collective mind, a surge of power—Ana Luisa senses the ripple but refrains from pursuit. Not today. Today, she is a mathematician of forces, a curator of energy. A player in the grand game of general classification where every watt is a pawn, every heartbeat a move on the chessboard.

She syncs with the rhythm of the peloton, the silent dialogue of wheels and wind. The breakaway riders cast their dice, but the main body simply adjusts, a hound confident its quarry will eventually falter.

Ana Luisa feels the rush as the peloton reels in the breakaway. It's not her battle, but she shares the exhilaration—their struggle is her struggle, their sport her obsession. The narrative of the stage unfurls around her, and she is an integral part of the drama.

On the horizon, Caen re-emerges. The city's skyline a finish line etched in stone and sky. The peloton surges towards it, a ravenous organism devouring the final kilometres. A young Belgian, Remco Evenepoel, breaks free in the dying moments, snatching victory from the sprinters' grasp.

Ana Luisa crosses the line within the peloton. Not a victor, but a survivor. A rider among riders, sharing the collective relief and fatigue. Her power wanes, her heart rate decelerates. This is her fifth stage, a minor triumph in the grand narrative of the Tour, but one she relishes.

As Caen recedes in her rear-view, Ana Luisa Ponsirenas anticipates the next stage, the next drama, the next chapter in the beautiful, savage narrative of the Tour. The story continues, and so will she.
