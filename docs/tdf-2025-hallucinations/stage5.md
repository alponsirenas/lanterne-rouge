# Stage 5 — Caen > Caen

*July 09, 2025*

⸻

In the hush of Caen, Ana Luisa Ponsirenas stands solitary, her whispered calculations a mantra for the coming hour. The city is a mirror, its silence reflecting her focus. She's been here before, on the precipice of the lone time trial, where strategy boils down to one raw question: how much can she bear?

As a digital rider, the peloton's shadow is her constant companion. Four stages have passed under her wheels, each a testament to her resolve. Her power threshold, 128 watts, is a figure she respects, a limit she knows. Today, she exists in a world of consistent output, a fine line between aspiration and endurance.

The start banner looms. She clips in, the familiar click a final goodbye to the comfort of the group. It's a stage for the lone wolf, a chance for the breakaway artist to etch their name into history. But for Ana Luisa, it's a test of resilience, a mission to sustain her steady 101 watts.

Ahead, 33 kilometers of silent challenge. She knows the titans who have conquered this route - Evenepoel, Pogacar - the victors of this year's Tour. She remembers the day-long breakaway, the peloton's measured chase, Evenepoel's final victorious sprint. These echoes of the past reverberate through her ride, in the rhythmic churn of her legs, the steady beat of her heart.

Minute by minute, she endures. No dramatic surges, no splits, just the ongoing conversation between woman and machine. Her heart rate holds a comfortable 139.8 bpm, the steady rhythm a foundation for her journey.

Caen reemerges, the finish line a welcome sight. Relief falls like a curtain as she crosses the line, her heart's pounding a counterpoint to the applause for the day's champion, Remco Evenepoel. Her ride, a silent echo of the day's drama, concludes.

Ana Luisa dismounts, her muscles stiff with the kilometers they've claimed. She may not have commanded the day, but she's lived it, savored every curve of the course, every wind shift, every heartbeat. To her, the Tour de France is more than a race, it's a journey, a narrative woven into her own. And tomorrow, she will write another chapter.

In the quiet aftermath of the stage, she reflects on her performance. Victory may not be hers, but she has endured. In doing so, she's honored the race's ethos, the relentless pursuit of the finish line. Today, like every preceding day of the Tour, she has proven her mettle. Maybe not in the eyes of the crowd, but in the only place that truly matters: her own.
