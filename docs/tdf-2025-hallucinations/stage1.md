“Philipsen: A Tenth and a First”

⸻

The neutral start is restless, but Ana Luisa sits in the belly of the pack, all nerves transformed into smooth, efficient circles—cadence in the 90s, heart at 140, watts steady as a metronome. It is the first day of the Tour, the first day of calculation. The air tastes of anticipation and the faint threat of rain.

At kilometer zero, the road erupts: the first breakaway launches immediately. Ana Luisa watches them flick away—a ritual, a kindness offered to the sponsors. Behind, the peloton rides without urgency; the pace is high, but not yet desperate. She drifts in the shelter of the bunch, the day’s tension a distant rumor.

Somewhere ahead, the break’s names echo in the race radio—Pacher, Bouchard, Declercq, the old regulars. The peloton lets them dangle; Philipsen, the points leader, is never far from the front, his team in green and black already calculating the finish.

Midway through the stage, the break is reeled in by the invisible hand of the peloton—no drama, no resistance, just the steady, certain logic of the Tour. Ana Luisa does not surge, does not follow attacks. Her power never exceeds necessity, legs turning, mind empty, not yet required.

The coast nears and the weather holds. Crashes, mechanicals, and panic stay away today. Every so often, she senses the nervous ripples ahead, but she is always in the right place—protected, invisible, a passenger in the machine.

Into the last kilometers, the teams form their sprint trains, the peloton’s pace doubling. Ana Luisa moves to the right, out of the wind, feeling the surge but not joining it. She rides for survival, for preservation. The power in her legs is untouched, her heart never frantic.

On the line, Jasper Philipsen throws his bike—tenth stage win, but his first opening stage. Applause, arms raised, the drama of the finish absorbed by the cameras and crowds. Ana Luisa’s race is elsewhere, somewhere deeper, quieter: in the discipline of restraint, the refusal to waste, the knowledge that the Tour is never won on the first day but can be lost with a single bad decision.

She crosses the line. No one notices. That’s how it should be. The real race—her race—begins tomorrow.
