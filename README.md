# Lanterne Rouge — Agentic AI for Every Athlete

> **Finish Every Stage. Win Your Own Race.**

## Why Lanterne Rouge?

In early 2025, a simple but bold idea was born:

**Create an indoor cycling event running parallel to the Tour de France** —  
riding every day for three weeks, simulating the endurance of the pros but adapted for real life.

From the very beginning, it wasn’t just about riding.  
It was about **envisioning the full experience**:

- A structured, progressive **training plan** to build endurance and resilience.
- A personalized **nutrition plan** to support recovery and adaptation.
- A simulation that honored the true spirit of the Tour de France —  
  **consistency over flash**, **grit over spectacle**.

We worked together to build this vision — creating the simulation event, designing the training phases, crafting the nutrition around it.  
But soon we realized:

> **How do we adapt daily to the real-world variables of fatigue, recovery, and life?**

Thus, **Lanterne Rouge** was born —  
an agentic AI training partner that observes, reasons, plans, acts, and adapts to help you finish every stage.

## What is Lanterne Rouge?

Lanterne Rouge is not just an application.  
It’s a **living, thinking AI agent**:

- **Observes** your readiness, fatigue, and training load.
- **Reasons** about whether to continue, modify, or adjust your training plan.
- **Plans** your next 14 days dynamically, always two weeks ahead.
- **Acts** autonomously on your Intervals.icu calendar to keep training aligned.
- **Reflects** on its decisions, building transparency and trust.

Inspired by the true Lanterne Rouge of the Tour de France —  
this AI embodies **perseverance, resilience, and intelligent endurance**.

## Vision

**Lanterne Rouge** is about more than finishing workouts.  
It’s about building consistency, resilience, and smart adaptation — no matter where you are on your fitness journey.

You don’t need to be racing at the front.  
You don’t need perfect training weeks.  
You don’t need to hit every interval flawlessly.

**You just need to show up.  
Adapt.  
Recover.  
And finish your own race.**

Lanterne Rouge is built to support that journey —  
for the beginner starting out, the rider rebuilding, and the seasoned athlete fine-tuning for the next challenge.

**Finishing every stage.  
Winning your own race.  
That is the true victory.**
