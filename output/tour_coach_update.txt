Date: Monday, June 30, 2025
Planned Workout:
- Given the current metrics and the mission plan for the Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025, let's evaluate the athlete's readiness and the necessary adjustments to today's workout. The goal is to ensure the athlete is on track for peak performance by the goal date of July 5, 2025, while also managing fatigue and readiness effectively. ()

Readiness and Recovery:
- Readiness Score: 76
- Readiness Day: 2025-06-30
- CTL (Fitness): 35.5
- ATL (Fatigue): 45.2
- TSB (Form): -9.7

Recommendation:
- âœ… All metrics look good. Proceed with planned workout.

- ### Current Metrics Overview:
- **Readiness Score**: 76
- **HRV Balance**: 80
- **CTL (Fitness)**: 35.5
- **ATL (Fatigue)**: 45.2
- **TSB (Form)**: -9.7
- ### Mission Plan Targets:
- **CTL Peak**: 55
- **Long Ride Minutes**: 75
- **Stage Climb Minutes**: 60
- **Threshold Interval Minutes**: 20
- ### Constraints:
- **Min Readiness**: 70
- **Max RHR**: Not provided, but HRV suggests good autonomic balance
- **Min TSB**: -15
- ### Analysis:
- The athlete's **readiness score** and **HRV balance** are both above the mission plan's minimum readiness constraint, indicating good overall readiness.
- The **TSB** is now at -9.7, which is within the acceptable range (above the minimum TSB constraint of -15), showing that the athlete has managed to recover from the previous state of moderate negative form.
- However, the **CTL** is still significantly below the target peak of 55, suggesting a need for further fitness improvement.
- ### Recommendations for Today's Workout:
- **Maintain Training Load but Adjust Focus**: Given the TSB is within a safer range, it's crucial to continue building towards the CTL target without introducing excessive fatigue. The focus should be on structured training that balances intensity and volume.
- **Long Ride Minutes**: Proceed with a long ride, aiming for the target of 75 minutes. Given the athlete's current state, this should be manageable without inducing excessive fatigue. Ensure the intensity is controlled, preferably in the aerobic zones (Zone 2 to Zone 3).
- **Stage Climb Minutes**: Incorporate stage climb efforts, targeting the 60-minute goal. To manage fatigue, these efforts should be evenly distributed within the ride, allowing for adequate recovery between efforts.
- **Threshold Interval Minutes**: Include threshold intervals, targeting the 20-minute goal. Since the athlete's form is now better, incorporating these efforts will aid in improving power at

Peloton Class Suggestion:
- No matching Peloton class found.

Notes:
- Adjust fueling based on today's effort. Stay hydrated and recover smart.
