Planned Workout:
- Given the mission plan for the Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025 and the current metrics of the athlete, here are the suggested workout modifications to ensure the athlete's readiness and performance are optimized for the goal event, aligning with the plan's targets and constraints: ()

Readiness and Recovery:
- Readiness Score: 71
- Readiness Day: 2025-06-26
- CTL (Fitness): 37.0
- ATL (Fatigue): 54.2
- TSB (Form): -17.2

Recommendation:
- ⚠️ Form is moderately negative (TSB < -15). Decrease today’s intensity or overall volume to allow recovery.
- Given the mission plan for the Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025 and the current metrics of the athlete, here are the suggested workout modifications to ensure the athlete's readiness and performance are optimized for the goal event, aligning with the plan's targets and constraints:
- ### Current Status:
- **Readiness Score**: 71 (Meets the minimum readiness constraint of 70)
- **HRV Balance**: 71
- **CTL (Chronic Training Load)**: 37.0 (Goal: 55)
- **ATL (Acute Training Load)**: 54.2
- **TSB (Training Stress Balance)**: -17.2 (Below the minimum constraint of -15, indicating fatigue)
- ### Immediate Workout Modifications:
- Given the athlete's current form (TSB: -17.2), which is below the minimum TSB constraint of -15, indicating a moderate level of fatigue, it's crucial to adjust today's workout to prevent overtraining and enhance recovery.
- **Reduce Overall Volume**: Considering the TSB level, reduce the overall volume of today's planned workout. If a long ride was planned, shorten the duration significantly. Aim for not exceeding 45 minutes of total workout time.
- **Decrease Intensity**: Today's workout intensity should be low. Avoid any high-intensity intervals or stage climbs. Focus on an easy spin or recovery ride intensity, ensuring heart rate zones stay within Zone 1 to Zone 2.
- **Specific Workout Adjustments**:
- **Long Ride Minutes**: If a long ride is planned, reduce to no more than 45 minutes.
- **Stage Climb Minutes**: Avoid any climb simulations today.
- **Threshold Interval Min**: Postpone any threshold intervals. Today's session should not include efforts near threshold intensity.
- ### Long-Term Training Adjustments:
- **Gradually Increase CTL**: Aim to gradually increase CTL to the goal of 55, without causing significant spikes in ATL that would further negatively impact TSB. This should be achieved through a careful balance of volume and intensity over the coming days.
- **Monitor and Adjust Based on Readiness and TSB**: Continuously monitor the athlete's readiness score, HRV balance, and TSB. Adjust the training plan dynamically to ensure the athlete remains within safe training stress levels.
- **Reintroduce Intensity and Volume Gradually**: Once the athlete's TSB improves to within or above the -15 constraint, begin to gradually reintroduce longer rides, stage climb minutes

Peloton Class Suggestion:
- No matching Peloton class found.

Notes:
- Adjust fueling based on today's effort. Stay hydrated and recover smart.
