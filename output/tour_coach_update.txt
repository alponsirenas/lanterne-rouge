Planned Workout:
- Given the latest metrics and the detailed mission plan for the Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025, there are several key points to consider for today's workout plan: ()

Readiness and Recovery:
- Readiness Score: 85
- Readiness Day: 2025-06-27
- CTL (Fitness): 33.2
- ATL (Fatigue): 38.9
- TSB (Form): -5.7

Recommendation:
- âœ… All metrics look good. Proceed with planned workout.
- Given the latest metrics and the detailed mission plan for the Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025, there are several key points to consider for today's workout plan:
- **Athlete's Current State**:
- **Readiness Score**: 85 - Indicates the athlete is well-recovered and ready for training.
- **HRV Balance**: 85 - Suggests a good balance, supporting readiness.
- **CTL (Chronic Training Load)**: 33.2 - This is significantly below the target peak of 55, indicating that the athlete's fitness level needs to be increased to meet the mission targets.
- **ATL (Acute Training Load)**: 38.9 - Indicates recent training load.
- **TSB (Training Stress Balance)**: -5.7 - While this is an improvement from the previous -17.1, it's still below the minimum TSB constraint of -15 but indicates the athlete is in a better state than before and can handle more training stress without the risk of overtraining.
- **Mission Targets**:
- The goal CTL peak of 55 suggests a need for progressive load increase.
- Targets for long ride minutes (75), stage climb minutes (60), and threshold interval minutes (20) are specific and crucial for success in the goal event but need to be approached carefully given the current CTL and TSB.
- **Today's Plan Adjustment**:
- Since the athlete's TSB has improved and readiness is high, we can slightly increase training load while still being mindful of the risk of overtraining. However, the main focus should be on increasing CTL towards the target, gradually and safely.
- ### Recommended Workout Modifications:
- **Increase Training Volume**: Given the improvement in TSB and high readiness, the athlete can handle a longer duration today. Consider extending the ride duration to closely match the 'long ride minutes' target but keep the intensity moderate to prevent excessive fatigue. Aim for a 60-75 minute ride.
- **Incorporate Stage Climb Minutes**: With the athlete's readiness and the need to prepare for the goal event, include some stage climb efforts in today's workout. Start with a lower volume, around 30-40 minutes, to gradually adapt to the target without overly stressing the athlete.
- **Threshold Intervals**: Introduce threshold intervals at a reduced volume. Given the athlete's readiness and improved TSB, including a total of 10-15 minutes of threshold intervals could be beneficial

Peloton Class Suggestion:
- No matching Peloton class found.

Notes:
- Adjust fueling based on today's effort. Stay hydrated and recover smart.
