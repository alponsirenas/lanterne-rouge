Date: Friday, June 27, 2025
Planned Workout:
- Given the current metrics and the mission plan for the Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025, it is clear that while the athlete's readiness score and HRV balance are both high today (85), indicating good overall readiness and recovery, the athlete's current form (TSB: -17.1) is still moderately negative and below the minimum TSB constraint of -15. This suggests that while the athlete is feeling ready and recovered, the accumulated fatigue is still too high, which could risk overtraining or injury if not managed properly. ()

Readiness and Recovery:
- Readiness Score: 85
- Readiness Day: 2025-06-27
- CTL (Fitness): 33.2
- ATL (Fatigue): 38.9
- TSB (Form): -17.1

Recommendation:
- ⚠️ Form is moderately negative (TSB < -15). Decrease today’s intensity or overall volume to allow recovery.

- ### Today's Workout Modifications
- Given the goal to optimize the athlete's performance for the upcoming Tour de France Indoor Simulation 2025, while also considering the athlete's current state, here are the recommended adjustments:
- **Reduce Overall Volume**: Today's workout should be adjusted to reduce the overall volume. The aim is to not exceed 60 minutes of total workout time, focusing on active recovery and low-intensity efforts.
- **Decrease Intensity**: Keep today's workout intensity low to aid recovery. The workout should primarily involve easy spinning or a recovery ride, with heart rate zones staying within Zone 1 to Zone 2. Avoid any high-intensity work or efforts that would significantly elevate heart rate.
- **Specific Adjustments**:
- **Long Ride Minutes**: If a longer ride was planned, it should be adjusted to no more than 60 minutes, focusing on easy, aerobic efforts.
- **Stage Climb Minutes**: Avoid any simulated stage climbs today to prevent additional fatigue.
- **Threshold Interval Minutes**: Postpone any threshold intervals or efforts. Today's session should focus on recovery, without any work near threshold intensity.
- ### Immediate Focus
- **Monitor and Manage Fatigue**: It's crucial to monitor the TSB closely in the coming days. The goal is to gradually improve the TSB to within or above the -15 threshold without compromising readiness.
- **Gradual Increase in CTL**: The CTL is currently at 33.2, which is below the target peak of 55. Plan for a gradual increase in CTL with a careful balance of training volume and intensity, ensuring the TSB does not drop further negatively.
- **Plan for Intensity Reintroduction**: As the TSB improves, start planning to reintroduce higher intensity and volume gradually. This includes longer rides, stage climb minutes, and threshold intervals, but only when the athlete's form allows for it.
- ### Long-Term Planning
- Given the goal date is approaching (July

Peloton Class Suggestion:
- No matching Peloton class found.

Notes:
- Adjust fueling based on today's effort. Stay hydrated and recover smart.
