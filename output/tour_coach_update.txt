Maintaining fitness while reducing fatigue for the big day.

📊 Current Fitness Metrics:
• Readiness Score: 76
• CTL (Fitness): 35.6
• ATL (Fatigue): 45.2
• TSB (Form): -9.6

🧠 Today's Training Logic:
• Decision: Ease
• Reasoning: Given your current metrics and the fact that you're in the taper phase with your goal event just 5 days away, it's crucial to fine-tune your condition without overdoing it. Your readiness score is decent at 76, indicating that you're not overly fatigued, but your Training Stress Balance (TSB) is at -9.6. This suggests you're carrying a bit of fatigue, which is expected during tapering, but we want to make sure this number moves closer to zero or slightly positive, indicating you're well-rested but not losing fitness as your event approaches. Easing off a bit will help reduce your Acute Training Load (ATL) and improve your TSB, ensuring you're in peak condition on the day of your goal. Since your Chronic Training Load (CTL) shows your long-term fitness is solid, we don't need to push hard now; maintaining what you've built is the priority. Let's focus on quality over quantity, with some light, sharp efforts to keep your legs feeling snappy.
