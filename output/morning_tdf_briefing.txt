🏆 TDF Simulation - Stage 7
🏔️ Stage Type: Flat Stage
==================================================

📊 READINESS CHECK:
• Readiness Score: 86/100
• TSB (Form): -21.0
• CTL (Fitness): 41.9

🎯 TODAY'S RECOMMENDATION:
• Ride Mode: GC
• Expected Points: 5
• Rationale: Given your TSB is at -21.0, it's evident you're experiencing substantial fatigue, which could be detrimental if pushed too hard. Opting for GC Mode today allows you to score base points while conserving energy. This approach aligns with the need to manage your fatigue, ensuring you remain competitive in the longer term of the TDF Simulation, especially with the flat stage type where strategic conservation of energy can be more beneficial.

📈 POINTS STATUS:
• Current Total: 44 points
• Stages Completed: 6/21

🏆 BONUS OPPORTUNITIES:
   • 5 Consecutive Stages
   • All GC Mode

🎖️ BONUS PROGRESS:
   • 5 consecutive: 1/5
   • 10 breakaways: 0/10

🧠 TRAINING STRATEGY:
• Training Focus: Maintain
• Intensity: Moderate
• Reasoning: Considering your current physiological state, with a readiness score of 86 which indicates a high level of readiness, and a TSB of -21.0 suggesting you're carrying a significant amount of fatigue, it's crucial to strike a balance between leveraging your readiness and managing fatigue. Today, maintaining your effort will help you capitalize on your readiness while not exacerbating your fatigue levels.

📝 STRATEGIC NOTES:
Your goal for today's stage is to focus on energy conservation while securing base points in GC Mode. This will aid in managing your current fatigue levels and prepare you for the upcoming stages. Additionally, pursuing the All GC Mode bonus could yield a significant points advantage. It's also important to keep an eye on the cumulative fatigue and readiness scores to make informed decisions in the stages ahead.

💪 Steady and smart for Stage 7. Every point counts, and consistency wins the long game!
