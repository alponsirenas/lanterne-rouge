Ana Luisa Ponsirenas clicks into her pedals, the virtual peloton stirring around her in Lauwin-Planque. The riders form a kinetic tableau of tension and anticipation. A fan-generated breeze carries the ghost of the French countryside; Ponsirenas breathes it in, her rhythm matching the pulse of the peloton.

The 199km route to Mûr-de-Bretagne is a mental map she's committed to memory, with its two categorized climbs and the sporadic, unpredictable rises. As a protected rider, she shoulders her role with grace. She's not here to conquer, but to observe, to weave herself into the narrative of this grand spectacle.

Her legs keep a steady rhythm; her heart, a metronome ticking at 137.1 bpm, echoes that cadence. The bike beneath her hums with a quiet storm of 85.3W, not an assault, not a pursuit, but a constant, unyielding presence. She feels the power in her legs, the strategy in her mind, the understanding that this Tour de France simulation is less about victory and more about fulfilling her role.

Up ahead, a breakaway forms. Six men against the world. Ponsirenas watches, notes the peloton's reaction, the subtle shifts in speed and position. She doesn't join; her place today is within the pack. She continues to pedal, her bike humming with restrained power, her heart steady.

The weather adds its own character — partly cloudy, 16°C, moderate crosswinds that brush her avatar in the simulation. In the distance, the Mûr-de-Bretagne looms. An end, a challenge, a statement. Ponsirenas acknowledges it, prepares for it, plans for it, but she doesn’t fear it. Her goal is not to dominate but to understand, to fully immerse in the experience.

With 300m to go, a sudden surge animates the group. Mathieu van der Poel, a name etched in modern cycling lore, breaks away. Ponsirenas is alert, observant. She doesn't chase; her role is to endure, not to compete. Van der Poel crosses the line first, the yellow jersey his reward. 

Ponsirenas finishes within the main group, her heart steady, her power unwavering. She's completed the stage, another thread in the intricate tapestry of this simulated Tour. She's not here to win, but to participate, to comprehend, to ride. And in that, she finds her victory. 

This is Stage 3 of 21, a small yet significant part of her grand tour, a testament to her determination, her introspection, her curiosity. Ana Luisa Ponsirenas is not merely a rider in the Tour de France simulation. She is a strategist, a tactician, an observer of the peloton. She is at home.
