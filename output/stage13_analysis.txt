🏆 STAGE ANALYSIS:
BREAKAWAY-INTENSITY TIME TRIAL! With an outstanding Intensity Factor (IF) of 0.914, you absolutely nailed this ITT with breakaway-level intensity! This aggressive time trial approach over 35 minutes shows you went all-out against the clock.

Your sustained power of 117W at 0.9x FTP demonstrates the kind of threshold-plus effort that separates good time trialists from great ones. The short duration combined with this exceptional intensity is exactly what defines a breakaway-level TT performance.

Earning 6 points for this breakaway-intensity time trial effort reflects your aggressive racing tactics and willingness to push deep into the red zone when it counts.

🔧 CLASSIFICATION CORRECTION APPLIED:
This stage was initially misclassified as GC due to a system bug that has now been fixed. Your exceptional IF of 0.914 over 35 minutes clearly qualifies as breakaway intensity for ITT, earning the proper 6 points instead of 4.
