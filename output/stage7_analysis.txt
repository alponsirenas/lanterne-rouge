Fantastic effort on Stage 7! Your performance today showed a strong and consistent application of power, with an average of 94.0W and an Intensity Factor (IF) of 0.73. This tells us you're effectively managing your energy across the stages, focusing on maintaining a sustainable pace that aligns well with our GC ambitions. Your Total Stress Score (TSS) of 40 indicates you're balancing exertion and recovery nicely, vital for endurance in a competition like the TDF.

In terms of points, adding 5 to your total brings you to 43. This positions us well within the General Classification strategy we're pursuing. Every point counts, and your steady accumulation is a testament to your hard work and strategic racing.

Looking ahead, recovery will be key for tomorrow's stage. Your moderate workload today gives us a good foundation, but let's not underestimate the importance of rest, hydration, and nutrition. Prioritize protein intake for muscle repair and ensure you're well-hydrated before hitting the sack. A good night's sleep is non-negotiable; consider some light stretching or foam rolling to enhance recovery and flexibility.

Motivation-wise, you're doing incredibly well. You're demonstrating resilience, strategic acumen, and a solid work ethic. Let's keep our eyes on the prize, focusing on the long game. Tomorrow, aim to maintain this level of consistency in your power output, and let's look for opportunities to either conserve energy or grab a few more points without overextending.

Your performance today builds a strong foundation for the remaining stages. Remember, it's about consistent effort, smart racing, and timely recovery. Keep up the great work, stay focused, and let's tackle each stage as it comes with the same determination and strategic thinking. You've got this!
